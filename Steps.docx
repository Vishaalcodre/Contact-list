Steps to create Contact List app

Tech Stack:
Frontend:
	React, JavaScript

Backend:
	Python, Flask

1. First Create a workspace
2. Inside the workspace create a backend folder 
	In the terminal, goto the workspace directory and enter this command 'npm create vite@latest frontend --template react'
	this command will create a react app inside the frontend folder 
	
	After creating react app change directory to frontend and install npm
	
	Typically when you build an application like this you want to build the backend or API first
	
	We are going to create a CRUD backend
	
	To build backend change the directory to backend folder and enter this command 'pip3 install Flask'
	
	And enter this command 'pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy' this known as Object Relational Mapping (ORM) which allows us to connect to the SQL DB and map 
	the entries and SQL into Python Objects so we can operate on our objects easier.
	
	And finally install 'pip3 install flask-cors' this is used to allow us to cross origin requests, 
	
	In backend folder create main.py, config.py and models.py
	
	config.py -> will contain the main configuration of our application
	main.py -> will contain the main routes or main endpoints
	models.py -> will contain all of our database models
